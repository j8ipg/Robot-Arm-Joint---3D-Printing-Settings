# Robot Arm Joint - 3D Printing Settings

This project includes optimized settings for 3D printing a robot arm joint using the **AnkerMake M5** printer and **PLA+ Basic** filament. The focus is on achieving maximum strength and print quality without significantly increasing print time.

## Selected Material: PLA+ Basic

PLA+ was selected due to the following advantages:
- Great mechanical strength for general-purpose parts.
- Easy to print without warping or special conditions.
- No need for an enclosure or high bed temperatures.
- Produces smooth surface finish.
- Suitable for low- to medium-load mechanical joints.

⚠️ For extreme durability or functional mechanical parts, switching to **PETG-CF** or **Nylon-CF** is recommended (requires a hardened nozzle).

## Print Quality Settings

- **Layer Height**: 0.16 mm → A good balance of precision and strength.
- **Line Widths**: 0.44 mm for walls → Improves bonding and wall rigidity.
- **Top Surface Line Width**: 0.3 mm → Better surface smoothness.
- **Seam**: Aligned with wiping enabled → Reduces layer seams for a cleaner look.

🟢 These settings ensure tight layer bonding and improved dimensional accuracy.

## Strength-Oriented Settings

- **Wall Loops**: 3 → Increases overall wall strength.
- **Top Layers**: 4 | **Bottom Layers**: 3 → Prevents top/bottom cracking.
- **Infill Density**: 60% (Cubic) → Strong internal structure with efficient material use.
- **Internal Solid Infill Line Width**: 0.44 mm → Enhances internal bonding.

🟢 Designed to create a robust print without going full 100% infill.

## Speed Optimization

- **Outer Wall Speed**: 75 mm/s → Maintains outer quality.
- **Inner Wall Speed**: 100 mm/s → Improves strength while staying efficient.
- **Sparse Infill Speed**: 200 mm/s → Fast but reliable.
- **First Layer Speed**: 20 mm/s → Improves bed adhesion.
- **Overhang Speed**: 15–30 mm/s → Reduces drooping in overhangs.

🟢 Balanced for strong layer adhesion while keeping the print time reasonable.

## Support Configuration

- **Supports Enabled**: Auto-generated at 30° overhang threshold.
- **Support Style**: Grid with detachable Z-distance (0.2 mm).
- **Top/Bottom Contact**: Easy removal without surface damage.

🟢 Ensures stable prints for complex geometries while keeping cleanup easy.

## Summary

These settings provide:

✔️ Strong, durable robot joint prints.  
✔️ High surface quality with minimal layer lines.  
✔️ Efficient print times without sacrificing integrity.  
✔️ Compatibility with standard PLA+ material and AnkerMake M5.

> All profiles are tested and ready for use in AnkerMake Studio.
